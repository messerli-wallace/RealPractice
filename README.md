# RealPractice Time-Based Practice Logger (Work in Progress)

RealPractice is a social app meant to log and track one's time-based practice (musical instrument practice, meditation, studying, etc). 
Practice is tracked via logging individual practice sessions. The user inputs time practiced and can provide a title, description, and tags for the type of practice they do.
Analytics for one's practice is provided on their profile page. Practice time over different intervals is provided.
Users can follow others, allowing for interaction on individual logs (liking and commenting).

Development is done by two university students using Next.js and Firebase.
